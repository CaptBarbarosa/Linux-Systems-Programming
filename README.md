# Linux Systems Programming

Welcome to the **Linux Systems Programming** repository! This repository contains various examples, exercises, and projects focused on Linux systems programming. The aim is to explore and understand how to interact directly with the Linux kernel, utilize system calls, and implement low-level programming techniques.

## Contents

- Examples of system calls and low-level programming in C
- Inter-Process Communication (IPC) techniques
- File and memory management
- Networking and socket programming
- Threading and process management
- Other Linux-specific programming techniques
